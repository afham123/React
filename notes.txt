Functions are of two in terms of asyncronus.
i. async Functions -> converstation with friend. -> compiler waiting for a process to be completed if we have added await.
ii. non-async function  -> converstation with one of your enemy.  ->  compiler never waits foe a process to be completed. It goes on executing the next line without waiting for the previous process to be completed.


async function fetchData () {
    data = await fetchFrom(server)
    print(data)
}
